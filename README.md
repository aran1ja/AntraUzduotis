# PirmaUzduotis

##### This program makes lists of students with their names, surnames, homework grades and exam results. Then, it calculates final grade for each student. If a student's avarage is less than 5, they are stored in a new file named "vargsiukai.txt". Otherwise, they are stored in the "kietiakiai.txt" file.

##### This program conducts speed tests to measure the time required for specific tasks. It calculates also the average time of all the times from each program.
